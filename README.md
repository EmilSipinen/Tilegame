Emil's Tile Game
=========================================================================

## Quickstart

Nothing besides the Python standard library is necessary to run this game. :)

```bash
python tilegame_prototype2.py Level.txt    # Python 3 specifically
```

## Controls

WASD to move, `exit` to quit.

## Hacker's Notes

- Each line in the level must have equal length.
- A character other than whitespace should be the first and last character on each line.
- The borders of the level should be represented by octothorpes ('#') to keep the player within the board boundaries.
- `Level.txt` currently gets **rewritten with every move** as a save mechanism. Be careful with your Git pushes!

Note: Along with the code, there are two example levels included in the repository for reference.
